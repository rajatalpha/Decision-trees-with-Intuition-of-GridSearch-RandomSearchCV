# Decision-trees-with-Intuition-of-GridSearch-RandomSearchCV
This repository gives explanation as to how to tune a simple decision tree, how did we prune it using the Hyper parameters, secondly we studied the difference between GridsearchCV and Randomsearchcv

Please see the pdf for a simple derivation stating the fact that -**the maximum of 60 random observations lie within top 5% confidence interval of the true maximum with 95% probability**
